#  DietLife - Indonesia Version

A simple app about introducing some Indonesian Cuisine while also sharing the awareness of calories intake to keep your body fit along with activities that could help burn more calories.

You will help the BMI (Body Measured Index) type of person (named Budi) of your selection to achieve an optimal diet for his days. Assuming he can teleport anywhere as long it's in Indonesia. You will be given choices of several Indonesian diets throughout the day and activities that help him balance out his diet. 
All activity and food options that will be given are multichoice, you can skip them if you want. Make sure you discover all foods.
At the end of the story, after you make choices, it will respond to how many calories he loses or add to his body with a normal BMI target in mind.
